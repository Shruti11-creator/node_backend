# Electronic Home lease, agreement & maintenance system

## About
The project backend will be handled by node.js and the the architecture will be headless. As such extending the application would be easier and the existing Node backend would help in making a scalable backend able to serve multiple clients. 

Here I've ruled out DENO as any advantages it provides will be nullified in r&d. 

As a start the first frontend webapp would be titled "Electronic Home lease, agreement & maintenance system".

**GIT** - For Linux use Terminal & gitbash for windows. Help resource [URL] (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

### Step 3: Cloning the repo & moving to development branch

**Take the repository url from**
- [repo_url] (https://github.com/abhigyansingh/tercio)
- at terminal or git bash enter `git clone <repo_url>`
- `cd` into project repository named tercio unless new name given
- Use `git status` to find the general stauts
- use `git checkout develop` to switch to develop branch
- To create & goto new branch '-b' can be used eg `git checkout -b hotfix2`

### Step 4: Installing Node

**Node** - 
- First install nodenv or nvm but not both. resource url - to [install nvm ->easy to understand] (https://medium.com/@nbanzyme/easy-way-to-install-nvm-on-ubuntu-18-04-2cfb19ee5391) ,or to [install nodeenv -> recomended] (https://github.com/ekalinin/nodeenv#nodejs-virtual-environment).
- Then install npm & node :persevere:

### Step 5: Installing Python (opt)

### Step 6: Installing the project
